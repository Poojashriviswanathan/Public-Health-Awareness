git clone https://github.com/yourusername/survey-data-visualization.git
cd survey-data-visualization
Install the required dependencies:

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Prepare your dataset:

Replace your_dataset.csv with the path to your actual survey dataset file in the script.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib for plotting graphs
seaborn for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics
Usage
Load your dataset:

Make sure your dataset file is in the correct path. The dataset should contain the necessary columns such as Gender, mental_health_consequence, Age, and treatment.

Run the script:

Execute the script to generate the visualizations:

Visualizations
Gender Distribution Pie Chart
This vibrant pie chart illustrates the distribution of genders in the survey dataset. It provides a quick visual overview of the gender representation within the surveyed population.

python
Copy code
# Example 1: Pie chart of Gender distribution
gender_counts = data['Gender'].value_counts()
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.pie(gender_counts, labels=gender_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.title('Gender Distribution')
plt.show()
Mental Health Consequence Bar Chart
This insightful bar chart visualizes the distribution of responses regarding the consequences of mental health issues. It helps in understanding the impact and prevalence of mental health consequences among the respondents.

python
Copy code
# Example 2: Bar chart of Mental Health Consequence
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
sns.countplot(x='mental_health_consequence', data=data)
plt.xlabel('Mental Health Consequence')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Mental Health Consequence Distribution')
plt.show()
